# helloWorld

Pardon my appearance.  My owner is currently working through a conversion to Jekyll using Ruby from raw HTML, JS, and CSS design for me.  This is involving a lot of learning, style changing and resource link adjustments.

Incase you are curious, the purpose of this site will be to host a blog containing:
- write-ups from CTFs
- project descriptions and walkthroughs of coding or hardware explorations
- general posts with thoughts, learning, or reviews of articles software and hardware
- school related projects I am doing

The last thing you will find is on the about me page.  Here you can link to all the other internet places my owner frequents or has a presence in.  For now please take a look at the this link: [about]({% link about.md %})
